The instances where the federal government re-prosecutes a state case are pretty rare, to my knowledge.\n\nAnd so, under the petite standard, and the petite -- the manifest injustice would -- it would have been a manifest injustice to have zero jail time, and zero registration, but if the original charges had remained, that would be a different matter. That does not mean that that is the best outcome in the state system.\n\nand so, perhaps beating a -- you know, an issue, but let me maybe give an example.

That means that we understand that the Florida system is different than the federal system.

It's not\n\n11 just interacting with the -- the -- the victims were in a\n\n12 really hard position. It's not -- how I would draw a\n\n13 distinction between a victim being interviewed by an agent,\n\n14 and how a victim holds up in court, in a public setting under\n\n15 cross examination, and in that, I don't think anyone in the\n\n16 office was questioning the pain or the suffering of the\n\n17 victims.

The\n15 first is, whether folks agree or disagree with the initial\n16 two years, you know, registration and restitution.\n\n17 The office's focus was on having Mr. Epstein go to\n18 jail at a time when, from our perspective, these -- these\n19 cases were, at least presented with these facts, federally at\n20 least unusual, and that most trafficking cases involved\n\n21 different -- a different sort of nexus.\n\n22 It involved bringing individuals into the country,\n23 or holding individuals against their will, or doing something\n24 like that, and -- and this will go to my second point which\n25 is, you know, sitting here, we now see several high profile"}, "p75i0": {"text": "Page 375\n\n1 individuals who abused power, and have now been prosecuted --\n2 who were known at the time who abused drugs, like Bill Cosby\n3 and -- who were -- there were rumors at the time, and you\n4 know, and -- and so, looking back, maybe it was the right\n5 call.\n\n6 Maybe it wasn't the right call, but there is some\n7 degree of -- I'm not sure what the right adjective is.\n8 Frustration, that -- and certainly, some of this goes to me,\n9 but I think a lot of this goes to \u2588, and the individuals\n10 involved, that the attempt to put someone in jail as opposed\n11 to decline the case and say this is just a state case,\n12 that -- that the -- that the federal issues are too tricky,\n13 that ultimately, this is sort of novel interpretations, that\n14 the attempt to come up with an outcome has rebounded in the\n15 way that it has, and I'm not -- I'm not saying, look, that\n16 that's life, and I understand that.\n\n17 But I do think it's important to look back on this,\n18 and try to be in the shoes of the thought process in 2006 and\n19 '07 when trafficking prosecutions were fairly new, when, you\n20 know, more so than today, some jurors may have looked at this\n21 as prostitution, and were -- perhaps more so than today --\n22 judge's tolerance for victim shaming may have both caused\n23 more hesitation on the part of victims, but also created more\n24 issues at trial.

Two\n9 years, registration, restitution. Despite all these\n10 attorneys, despite all these appeals, despite all these\n11 efforts, the office did not budge with the caveat of the 24\n12 to 18 months, which we've discussed, and from my perspective,\n13 despite all of that, I backed the office in sticking by that\n14 resolution in the various appeals to Washington.\n\n15 And so ultimately, it was a year-long process, but\n16 we ended up a year later exactly where we started with the\n17 caveat of the 24 to 18.

That this team of\n20 defense attorneys --\n21 A Right.\n22 Q -- had extraordinary access, that they asked for\n23 meetings, they --\n24 A Right.\n25 Q -- pressed for -- with communications, and they had"}, "p78i0": {"text": "Page 378\n\n1 that access.

That's not the first and only time\n\n6 that I granted a meeting to -- to defense attorneys. I don't\n\n7 think it's atypical, particularly as a case is coming to --\n\n8 to resolution -- for a U.S. Attorney to sit down and meet\n\n9 with opposing counsel, and I can think of several cases where\n\n10 that happened.

If an\n6. attorney after meeting with my management staff asked for a\n7. meeting with me, I believe I did and would have granted it,\n8. and I can think of several matters on which those types of\n9. meetings were granted. And so, that was not unusual.\n10. Q. All right.\n11. A. With respect to the back and forth after the\n12. agreement was signed? This was an unusual agreement, and to\n13. some extent, as a result, the back and forth quickly\n14. elevated, particularly because matters would elevate in\n15. particular when they were being addressed at main justice.\n16.

So, after the Jessie Smollett plea in Chicago,\n\n20 there was some discussion of whether the federal government\n\n21 should bring charges, and I remember the media saying that,\n\n22 and I haven't used this analogy, because I don't want to\n\n23 compare, and I think it would be disrespectful to compare the\n\n24 facts of that case to what happened to these victims, and I\n\n25 still -- and I don't want the comparison to be drawn, but"}, "p82i0": {"text": "Page 382\n\n1. there is a legal comparison, right?\n\n2.

No jail time was a manifest injustice. If he\n3 had gone to jail for two years in the state system and\n4 registered, the question of whether it would have come to the\n5 office at all, and to my recollection, the consensus was, and\n6 \u2588, based on Exhibit 3, agrees with that, that it would\n7 never have come to the office in the first place, because we\n8 would not view that under petite as a manifest injustice.\n9\n10 There are any number of cases that are prosecuted\n11 around the country where an individual gets a jail time that\n12 the federal government may not agree with, but that doesn't\n13 mean that the federal government reprocutes those cases.\n14 The instances where the federal government reprocutes a\n15 state case are pretty rare, to my knowledge.\n16\n17 And so, under the petite standard, and the\n18 petite -- the manifest injustice would -- it would have been\n19 a manifest injustice to have zero jail time, and zero\n20 registration, but if the original charges had remained, that\n21 would be a different matter. That does not mean that that is\n22 the best outcome in the state system.\n23\n24 and so, perhaps beating a -- you know, an issue,\n25 but let me maybe give an example. One concern that I had was\n26 that in the violent crime side, the state brings a case, and\n27 you know, there is a deferment, no jail time. The state then\n28 brings a second case, and there's minimal jail time.

That\n10 doesn't mean that all of those cases get reprocuted as gun\n11 cases in Florida.\n12\n13 That means that we understand that the Florida\n14 system is different than the federal system. And so, the way\n15 we looked at, at least based on my recollection, those two\n16 years was not, what would he have received if this was a\n17 purely federal case, but would this case have been prosecuted\n18 by the federal system additionally if he had received jail\n19 time and registration in the state system?\n20\n21 Q And would -- is it fair to say that this particular\n22 concern about, for lack of a better word, federalism or the\n23 petite policy, was that a primary concern of yours versus any\n24 of your employees in terms of [REDACTED] or [REDACTED]?\n25\n26 A I think it's fair to say that I focused more on the\n27 legal side of things, and my team focused more on the trial\n28 and how this would play out at trial, and both of them --\n29 both of them sort of informed the outcome."}, "p14i0": {"text": "Page 214\n\n1 Q And are you including this petite policy in your\nconsideration of the legal issues?\n\n2 A Yes.

The\n15 first is, whether folks agree or disagree with the initial\n16 two years, you know, registration and restitution.\n\n17 The office's focus was on having Mr. Epstein go to\n18 jail at a time when, from our perspective, these -- these\n19 cases were, at least presented with these facts, federally at\n20 least unusual, and that most trafficking cases involved\n\n21 different -- a different sort of nexus.\n\n22 It involved bringing individuals into the country,\n23 or holding individuals against their will, or doing something\n24 like that, and -- and this will go to my second point which\n25 is, you know, sitting here, we now see several high profile"}, "p75i0": {"text": "Page 375\n\n1 individuals who abused power, and have now been prosecuted --\n2 who were known at the time who abused drugs, like Bill Cosby\n3 and -- who were -- there were rumors at the time, and you\n4 know, and -- and so, looking back, maybe it was the right\n5 call.\n\n6 Maybe it wasn't the right call, but there is some\n7 degree of -- I'm not sure what the right adjective is.\n8 Frustration, that -- and certainly, some of this goes to me,\n9 but I think a lot of this goes to \u2588, and the individuals\n10 involved, that the attempt to put someone in jail as opposed\n11 to decline the case and say this is just a state case,\n12 that -- that the -- that the federal issues are too tricky,\n13 that ultimately, this is sort of novel interpretations, that\n14 the attempt to come up with an outcome has rebounded in the\n15 way that it has, and I'm not -- I'm not saying, look, that\n16 that's life, and I understand that.\n\n17 But I do think it's important to look back on this,\n18 and try to be in the shoes of the thought process in 2006 and\n19 '07 when trafficking prosecutions were fairly new, when, you\n20 know, more so than today, some jurors may have looked at this\n21 as prostitution, and were -- perhaps more so than today --\n22 judge's tolerance for victim shaming may have both caused\n23 more hesitation on the part of victims, but also created more\n24 issues at trial.

How do you respond to public criticism\n\n16 that the defense attorneys -- the Epstein defense team, were\n\n17 gaining extraordinary access to an influence on prosecutors\n\n18 from the line level all the way up through the department?\n\n19 A So, I would point out early on in the case -- when\n\n20 I said early, you pushed back, but from my perspective, early\n\n21 on in the case.

And I -- I think I addressed some of this in the\n2 Daily Beast's letter.\n\n3 Q Mn-hmm.\n\n4 A Because we were receiving criticism back then, and\n5 I think that letter has been misconstrued to some extent,\n6 because it was not, oh, here are influential people, we're\n7 backing off.\n\n8 It was, we, early on, set three criteria. Two\n9 years, registration, restitution. Despite all these\n10 attorneys, despite all these appeals, despite all these\n11 efforts, the office did not budge with the caveat of the 24\n12 to 18 months, which we've discussed, and from my perspective,\n13 despite all of that, I backed the office in sticking by that\n14 resolution in the various appeals to Washington.\n\n15 And so ultimately, it was a year-long process, but\n16 we ended up a year later exactly where we started with the\n17 caveat of the 24 to 18. And so, to the extent that there was\n18 influence, there was -- there was no change in position.\n\n19 Q Well, my question was access. That this team of\n20 defense attorneys --\n21 A Right.\n22 Q -- had extraordinary access, that they asked for\n23 meetings, they --\n24 A Right.\n25 Q -- pressed for -- with communications, and they had"}, "p78i0": {"text": "Page 378\n\n1 that access.

That's not the first and only time\n\n6 that I granted a meeting to -- to defense attorneys. I don't\n\n7 think it's atypical, particularly as a case is coming to --\n\n8 to resolution -- for a U.S. Attorney to sit down and meet\n\n9 with opposing counsel, and I can think of several cases where\n\n10 that happened. There was certainly a lot of access in\n\n11 Washington. I would speak to -- you know, I think that's a\n\n12 question to direct to this building.\n\n13 Q Mn-hmm.\n\n14 A Because the process here was lengthy, and\n\n15 frustrating.

If an\n6. attorney after meeting with my management staff asked for a\n7. meeting with me, I believe I did and would have granted it,\n8. and I can think of several matters on which those types of\n9. meetings were granted. And so, that was not unusual.\n10. Q. All right.\n11. A. With respect to the back and forth after the\n12. agreement was signed? This was an unusual agreement, and to\n13. some extent, as a result, the back and forth quickly\n14. elevated, particularly because matters would elevate in\n15. particular when they were being addressed at main justice.\n16.

So, after the Jessie Smollett plea in Chicago,\n\n20 there was some discussion of whether the federal government\n\n21 should bring charges, and I remember the media saying that,\n\n22 and I haven't used this analogy, because I don't want to\n\n23 compare, and I think it would be disrespectful to compare the\n\n24 facts of that case to what happened to these victims, and I\n\n25 still -- and I don't want the comparison to be drawn, but"}, "p82i0": {"text": "Page 382\n\n1. there is a legal comparison, right?\n\n2.

So, I spoke with \u2588 about the case, and he spoke with Alex, and they gave the green light.\"\n\n3 So, that -- that actually appears to be an initial contact with \u2588 that she's talking about prior to the briefing of you, so, way early when the case first came in in May of 2006. Do you recall being contacted or having a conversation with --\n\n4 A Min-hm.\n\n5 Q -- \u2588 \u2588 about that case so early?\n\n6 A Again, the early recollection, whenever -- whenever it might have taken place, was I was made aware of the matter. It seemed a reasonable matter to pursue, and that's the level of detail that I recall.\n\n7 Q So, if \u2588 said back in the day that she got from you all the green light, what did you understand her to be being authorized to do -- authorize may be too strong a word, but --\n\n8 A So, to pursue -- to investigate -- to pursue --\n\n9 Q Yeah.\n\n10 A -- to someone, you know, I -- I'm speculating here,"}, "p40i0": {"text": "Page 41\n\n1 but there's a case, and they want to know, should we spend\n2 our time on this?

Reading\n16 the testimony and listening to the tapes, or reading the\n17 transcript, there were a few discrepancies.\n\nOne of the first ones we talked about was what\n19 \u2588 had told her about going to Mr. Epstein's house.\n20 She tells detective \u2588 that she was told about the\n21 massage, told about getting $200, but that she was not\n22 told that she would have to take her clothes off. She\n23 didn't know she would have to perform the massage naked.\n\nWhen I asked her last night that question, she\n25 told me that when she got to the house prior to going into"}, "p18i0": {"text": "Page 19\n\n1 Mr. Epstein's residence, that \u2588 did tell her that she\n2 may be asked to take off her clothes.

That would be one.\n8\n9 The second discrepancy I wanted to touch on with\n10 her was going upstairs and taking off her clothing. When\n11 she is in that room, she states to detective \u2588 that\n12 \u2588 asked her to remove her clothing, and she took off\n13 her shirt. Then Mr. Epstein came in the room, shook her\n14 hand and told her to take off her clothes. He leaves, he\n15 comes back in a towel. He tells her again. \u2588 tells\n16 detective \u2588 in a stern voice, \"Mr. Epstein told me to\n17 take off my pants.\" Because she hadn't taken off her\n18 pants from the first time that she met him.\n19\n20 In her testimony with the grand jury with the\n21 state, she tells the grand jury that it was \u2588 who\n22 asked her to remove her clothing. So last night we went\n23 over with her who told her to remove what. She had a very\n24 hard time recalling exactly. She knew she had gotten down\n25 to her bra and underwear. And then at some point, when\n26 we're going through the sexual activity, she actually\n27 tells me that her underwear was off when he was \u2588"}, "p19i0": {"text": "Page 20\n\n1.

As we are walking\n6. through the sexual activity, she does recall and states.\n7. that it was Mr. Epstein who told her to take off her\n8. pants.\n\n9. I guess I'll go to the third discrepancy. Is\n10. there anything I left off with that?\n\n11. Q: Well, does she report that when the assistant\n12. leads -- or the blonde lady leads her upstairs, that the\n13. blonde lady also said, \"Get undressed,\" but that \u2588\n14. didn't get fully undressed?\n\n15.

Q: That the lady said first, \"Get undressed,\" but\n19. she doesn't get fully undressed. And when Jeffrey comes\n20. back, he said, \"Take your pants off.\"?\n\n21. A: Yes.

She knows\n6 her underwear was off, but she cannot tell you exactly at\n7 what point her underwear was removed.\n8\n9 Q Let's talk about the third discrepancy.\n10 A The third is the sexual activity, when she was\n11 originally interviewed by detective \u2588 about the\n12 \u2588.
